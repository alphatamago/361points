<h2>Learning from professional games (1)</h2>

<p>This article is based on <a href="http://www.361points.com/meijin2007/#game1">game 1 of the Meijin title, 2007</a>. The main idea came from raw variations I saw on CyberOro Go server during this game, which were most likely analysis of professional players following the game.</p>

<p>After move 32 in the game, the position in the upper-right corner is the one in Dia 1.</p>

<p>The local situation looks bad for Black: in the close fight White has one extra stone (but it is Black's turn next), and White has 2 more stones nearby (on the left and below) which will surely help if a fight spreads. But that doesn't mean that Black shouldn't try his best: Black should start by looking at the most severe continuations first.</p>

<p>Try to find the most promising, aggressive continuation for Black in Dia 1.</p>

<p>The most promising continuation seems to be one that creates a double-threat. After 1 and 3 in Dia 2, Black makes miai starting a ladder with A (which is favorable for him in this game), and capturing two White stones with B.</p>

<p>There are two sides though in each Go game. Ignoring the opponent's possibilities usually result in a loss. Let's think from the White's perspective as well: White to play in Dia 2 - do your best.</p>

<div class="solution">
<p>White has a tesuji up his sleeve, too: the forcing move 4 which is atari (Black has to connect at 5) takes care of the B threat in Dia 2, so White can go ahead next and eliminate the A threat in Dia 2 by capturing with 6 in Dia 3.</p>

<p>Dia 4 shows why 4 in Dia 3 works for White: Black 7 cannot capture the two White stones anymore: White wins the semeai in the corner next.

</div>

<p>Back to Dia 1: Black tried his best to look up at the most aggressive continuation, which was Dia 2, but found out that White has the tesuji in Dia 3 to the rescue, so Black has to settle for something more peaceful. In a close fight, when we cannot save all of our stones, we have to think about sacrifice.</p>

<p>Black has to sacrifice three stones: Dia 5 shows the continuation in the real game.</p>

</div>

<p>Even if Dia 2 doesn't work for Black in this case, it is definitely worthwhile understanding the idea behind it: you'll find a situation when it does work!</p>
<p>The second tesuji worth remembering is White 4 in Dia 3. Both tesuji from Dia 2 and Dia 3 can occur in close fights, in a lot of different positions: make sure you remember them.</p>
