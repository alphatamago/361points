<h2>AlphaGo/Master</h2>

<p>AlphaGo proved that Go is much more complicated that we thought, and even after perfecting this game for hundreds of year, humans are still easily defeatable by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXKUuHnbyiE">AlphaGo using very simple-looking moves</a>.

</p><p>How strong exactly is the Master version of AlphaGo? The professionals playing with it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rdo9BKniyOc">had various reactions</a> and <a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10210499878164941&amp;id=1584704147">gave different estimations</a>. Personally I believe that the latest AlphaGo version can give 3 stones handicap to top pros and still win.

</p><p>Here are some interesting moves from the 60-0 series - the marked move is AlphaGo's:
