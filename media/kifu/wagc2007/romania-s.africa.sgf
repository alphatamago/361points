http://breakfast.go4go.net/];B[pd]C[This is the game from the World Amateur Go Championship-2007. Black is Cristian Pop, 6-dan (Romania). White is Victor Guang Chow, 6-dan (South Africa)];W[fd];B[pp]
;W[eo]C[The opening is weird, but it's typical for Victor Guang Chow. He has an 8-dan account on IGS and beat lot of professionals by playing such openings];B[cd];W[cc];B[dc];W[dd];B[db];W[cb];B[bb];W[bc]
(;B[ed]C[Nowadays this joseki is popular -];W[de];B[ee]
(;W[ec]C[White is playing for influence -];B[eb];W[fc];B[bd];W[ef];B[ca]
;W[fe]C[The result is equal. White's shape is extra-thick, but it's not easy to use it for making territory, because of open skirts from the both sides]
(;B[jp]C[The best place -];W[fq]
;B[pn]LB[mp:A][nq:B]C[Black may also defend at A or B]
(;W[lq]C[The invasion looks natural -];B[ko]C[The right answer];W[nq]LB[pq:A]C[It looks heavy. It's better to think about an attachment at A];B[mp]C[The vital point];W[pq];B[qq]
;W[qr]C[It's not easy for White to create a good shape here]
(;B[pr]C[A sharp plan -];W[oq];B[rr];W[qp];B[qs];W[rq];B[qr]
;W[no]LB[po:A]C[It's probably better to start from the atari at A, getting more sente moves];B[qo]
;W[lp]LB[nm:A]C[Is it better to jump at A?];B[km]
;W[nm]C[White is one step slow];B[mn];W[nn];B[mo];W[mq]
;B[jq]C[A sharp move];W[nk]C[White's group is weak, so he cannot play actively];B[ml];W[nl]
;B[lj]TR[ec][dd][fd][de][fe][ef]C[Black's group is getting stronger, so the marked wall is getting less and less attractive];W[ql]LB[ni:A]C[It's probably better to jump at A];B[co];W[cq]
;B[dm]LB[cl:A]C[The low extension at A is normal here];W[ck]LB[qf:A][em:B]C[A good move, but it's better to start from the kakari at A. Later White can attach at B, separating Black's groups];B[fn];W[qf]
;B[ni]C[A very thick move];W[pi]C[White has no choice. He has to defend];B[nc]
;W[rd]C[Too passive];B[qc]LB[kc:A]C[Black may think about extending at A];W[do];B[cp];W[dq];B[bq];W[br];B[dk];W[dj];B[ek]
(;W[cm]TR[co][cp][bq]C[I would prefer to cut off the marked stones -];B[cn];W[cl]
;B[dn]C[Now Black's shape is just ideal];W[go]C[It's already slow];B[cf]C[A huge move];W[ej]C[White is making his opponent stronger by pushing like this];B[fj];W[fi];B[gj];W[gi];B[hi];W[hh]
;B[hj]TR[ec][fc][dd][fd][de][fe][ef]C[Black is happy to connect his groups. 

We may see that the marked wall is exactly useless];W[ih];B[ch]
;W[ci]LB[ei:A]C[There is a big weakness at A, so White has to defend it];B[dh];W[ei]
;B[kc]C[Black ends in sente. Now he has a clear lead on territory];W[rc];B[ph];W[qh]
;B[qi]C[An aggressive idea. Actually it was not necessary to fight like this]
(;W[oh]C[It's not easy for White to find the answer -];B[pg];W[qg];B[pj];W[oi]
;B[pl]C[A good move];W[pk];B[qk];W[pm];B[oj];W[nj]
;B[rl]LB[nh:A]C[Black may start from the atari at A];W[ol];B[rm]
;W[mi]C[The result is successful for Black. He destroyed lot of points in sente];B[gn]LB[nh:A]C[Black can run at A, but it's not necessary for him];W[io];B[gp];W[fo]
;B[ho]C[A nice tesuji];W[hp];B[hn];W[ip];B[hq];W[iq];B[ir];W[hr];B[in];W[gq]
;B[jo]C[Black's shape becomes very thick];W[fp]
;B[ji]LB[nh:A]C[Black can still run at A, but he is trying to keep the game simple];W[ri];B[qj];W[nh]
;B[hc]TR[ec][fc][dd][fd][de][fe][ef]C[Black got the last important place. Now he has a clear 15 points lead on the board.



We can say, that White lost this game, because he did not use the marked thickness at all.];W[rj];B[rk];W[rb];B[he];W[hf];B[if];W[ge];B[hd];W[oe];B[pe]
