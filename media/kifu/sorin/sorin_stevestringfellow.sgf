There is nothting wrong with playing the normal sequence: White A, Black B, White C - after reinforcing first in the upper left. See the variation.]

I was worried that White might play here and leave the upper left group of Black's without eyes, but Black can jump out around A, and that would not be a good exchange for White, either - because Black A would help with reducing White's moyo in the lower left.];W[ie]LB[gc:A]C[Overplay: should be at A.];B[lc]LB[fd:C][gd:A][ge:B]C[Much more severe at A; if White B, Black C.];W[nb];B[le];W[qe];B[re];W[pe]
