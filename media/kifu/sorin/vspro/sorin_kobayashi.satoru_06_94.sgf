Info about Satoru sensei: http://gobase.org/information/players/?pp=Kobayashi%20Satoru
Info about Chizu sensei: http://gobase.org/information/players/?pp=Kobayashi%20Chizu

This was not something planned ahead of time: I happened to be at Nihon Kiin with Hans Pietsch who was in A class at that time, where he was having weekly teaching games with Satoru sensei. After his game, Satoru sensei asked to play with me as well.
This was about half year before he became Kisei.

Game commentaries by Satoru sensei (unfortunately I didn't record the comentaries at that time, I am just recalling 1-2 points in the game where Satoru sensei provided some comments).]RE[W+Resign]
