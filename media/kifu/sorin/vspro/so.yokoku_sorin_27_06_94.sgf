PW[Sorin Gherman]PB[So Yokoku]BR[2p]DT[1994-06-27]EV[Kenkyukai]PC[Rin Kaiho's house]C[This is a fast game (10 seconds per move) I played at Rin Kaiho Sensei's house, during a "kenkyukai" (study meeting). My opponent's name is So Yokoku ( http://gobase.org/information/players/?pp=So%20Yokoku ), professional 2 dan at that time, now (2002) 7 dan. 

When I became an insei in 1994, he had just became pro shodan, and was still living at the Igo Kenshu Center. In April that year he debuted as pro, and quickly became 2 dan.
