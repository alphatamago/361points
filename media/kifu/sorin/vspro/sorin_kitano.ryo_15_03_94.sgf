It was played in the spring of 1994, next month after I came to be an insei in Japan. It is played with 20 points reverse komi (white offers komi) instead of traditional handicap stones.

Kitano sensei came several times to Romania to teach Go. When I came to Japan as an insei, we were both invited by a common friend (Shima san) to his house in Tokyo.]RE[B+Resign]
