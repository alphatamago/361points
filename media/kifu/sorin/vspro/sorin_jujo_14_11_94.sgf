(;B[qg]LB[fd:B][qm:A]C[This is a bad move anyway (it is not a kikashi as black intended). A good move on the right side would be an approach move at A (R7).

If we look at the whole board, though, it's black's chance now to play a double kakari in the upper-left corner, at B (F16). If white plays there first it makes too much teritory in that area and he gets a good game, so black should prevent that.
