(;W[qm]LB[fc:A]CR[qm]C[Not a good idea to play on this side; white has no reasons yet to choose between playing from above or from below on the right side, so he should play somewhere else for now and decide later.
Biggest move at this moment is the kakari at A.]

;W[qe]LB[lc:B][qc:C]TR[ob]CR[qe]C[White's groups in the upper right has a very bad weakness at the triangle-marked point (which makes miai next B and C): one more reason why settling the right side so early was bad for white.]
(;B[pq]LB[fd:E][df:D]SQ[gp][fq]CR[pq]C[The lower side is very small for now, it's impossible for both black and white to get any important amount of territory here because of the sqare-marked stones. Therefore, for black to invade here it's not urgent.
Biggest move for black would be to make a shimari in the upper-left corner, at D or E.]

;W[qp]LB[no:G][po:H][qr:F]CR[qp]C[Very good; normally white descends at F instead, but in this case black would answer at G (which normally is followed by white H) and then switch to the upper left-corner.
This connection makes much more difficult for black to tenuki now.]

Black should either play at B (if he had counted and he's confident that that's enough to win), or to attack at C (in case B isn't enough), or to simply play somewhere else (for instance at D) before deciding what approach to take in the center.]
