C[It's becoming popular for black to play tenuki after the lower side sequence.]

W[mq]
C[This is definitely aji-keshi. What white should aim at is to attack at O3. See the variation for a discussion  on that move.]
;
B[lr]
C[Black should play at M4, white M5, black connects at L3, white defends at G5, black N4, white O4, black O3.
White still has weaknesses on the outside.]
;
W[qh]
C[This is the wrong direction. I explained that I wanted to play away from my thickness and drive black into it, but Rui said that white should play at R8 in this situation: first of all it makes some teritorry on the lower side, than white is not actually so strong here: it still has many cutting points to worry about.]

C[Black should jump once more, at N10, to defend his weak group.]
;
W[mi]
C[This is severe.]
;

W[rm]
C[This is a total failure: it ruins all white's attack.
White should have continued the attack with a nozoki at Q9.]
;
B[ql]
;
W[ch]
C[White has a weak point in the upper right corner, at san-san. Since he played so many moves there, it's time to defend the corner now, at P17.
If black invades it's going to be too painful.]

C[Black has another option here, to go for thickness with C17. See the variation for Rui's commentary on that.]
;
W[eh]
C[This tobi is correct given black's anser in the corner: white has created aji on the upper side (he can aim next at G17, F18, etc).]

C[This is what white's aim should be as far as the lower side is concerned. But playing it directly may be dangerous: black attacks bluntly at G4 and white is in trouble.
White can play at F7 before: if black answers at D8 (this exchange is not so bad for white, since black already has the D10 stone in place) then white can attack at O3.]
