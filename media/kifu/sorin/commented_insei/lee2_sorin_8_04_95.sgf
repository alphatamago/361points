The correct move is to crawl at A (L3) and so on, taking territory. Black's K4 is dubious, it transforms all lower side into white's territory.]

This is just creating another group for white, and another target to attack for black, who has thickness and want to attack.
White should just reinforce himself with something like A (J14), reducind black's center potential at the same time.
