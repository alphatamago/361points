PW[Tsuruyama Atsushi]PB[Sorin Gherman]DT[1994-03-12]EV[C class]C[My opponent, Tsuruyama Atsushi ( http://www.nihonkiin.or.jp/player/htm/ki000365.htm ), is now ( 2002) pro 4 dan. 

This game is one of the first games in C class. It remained vivid in my memory due to a mistake I made by ignoring a basic Go proverb: "don't let your opponent play hane at the head of 3 stones".

The tsuke at A is the recommended approach in this situation: cut opponent's stones, don't help him connect!]

(;B[nq]LB[fc:C][gc:A][ie:B]C[Black should play the big move at A (G17) instead (it is big because a white move at C (F17) is sente, threatening the black corner).
If white answers at B (J15), then black can play shimari in the lower-right corner, as in the game.]

(;B[fl]LB[ip:a]C[This falls in white's trap: it is too defensive and makes white's last move a good one. Instead, black should either extend on the lower side at "a", aiming at white's thinness or play more aggresive, as in the variation.]

(;B[ne]LB[lc:A][ql:B]C[This is bad: even if white do answer by connecting, the result is that white's upper side's weak point at A dissapears!
White did even better, by ignoring black's peep.

Black should play at B with this move, attacking white's stone on the left.]

Black should prevent this and extend from the 3 stones, at A (O13): it's the only move in this situation.

I'll never forget this position...
