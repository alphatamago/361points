PW[Cho Riyu]PB[Sorin Gherman]DT[1994-04-29]EV[C class]C[My opponent, Cho Riyu, was in his second month as an insei. He started in D class, the lowest one, as a newcomer a month before, but he had already A class strength. He became a pro 2 years after this game.
He is now (2002) 5 dan pro.
Here's a link to the Nihon Kiin page about him: http://www.nihonkiin.or.jp/player/htm/ki000352.htm and here's one to an English page: http://gobase.org/information/players/?pp=Cho%20Riyu
