PW[Kato Keiko]PB[Sorin Gherman]DT[1994-02]EV[training game]PC[Igo Kenshu Center]C[My opponent, Kato Keiko ( http://www.nihonkiin.or.jp/player/htm/ki000364.htm ) is now (2002) pro 4 dan. She used to live at the Igo Kenshu Center as an insei.

This is a fast, training game we played there. The training games were usually 10 seconds per move. Only the beginning of the game is recorded.

Commentary by Kitano Ryo 6 dan ( http://gobase.org/information/players/?pp=Kitano%20Ryo ). Kitano sensei has been several time in Romania teaching Go. We met soon after my arrival in Japan at a friend's (Hiroshi Shima) house in Tokyo for a couple of days.]RE[W+Resign]

Another idea I considered for this move was to invade in san-san, but this is not good, either: white would become thick, cancelling trhe black influence in the center.]
