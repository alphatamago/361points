PW[Sorin]PB[insei from Osaka]DT[1994-08]EV[Hakone Go camp training game]PC[Hakone, Japan]C[Each summer, an insei camp was organized at Hakone, a beautiful touristic spot. All 3 Nihon Kiin branches (Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya) would send their inseis there to play and study Go together.
This game is played during such a study group. For the several days of  staying there, the inseis were again split into classes (as in the official insei league), but we played many games a day so promotions and demotions were very fast.
Another difference from the official insei league: the insei instructors were also playing in A class, making the contest all the more interesting.

Commentary by Tei Meikou 9 dan ( http://gobase.org/information/players/?pp=Tei%20Meiko ), one of the 3 official Tokyo insei instructors at that time.]RE[B+0.50]
