;B[qc]LB[pi:A]CR[qc]C[This is ok for black (I asked sensei if answering here is not too soft for black). It's not at all clear that exchanging white 20 for this black 21 is gaining white anything compared to defending directly at A (Q11).
Of course, for black to play himself at A and start a fight is also playable.]

(;B[en]LB[nq:A]CR[en]C[This is normally a very good move for black in the left side situation, but in this game white has strong positions everywhere, so for black to build a moyo doesn't look very appropriate. Better play a territorial move, at A (O3).]
(;W[bh]LB[ip:A]CR[bh]C[Overplay. White should play at A (J4).]
(;B[ch]LB[bg:A]CR[ch]C[Too soft: black should play at A (B13) for a strong attack on white. Even if white manages to make 2 eyes, he won't going to profit from his invasion.]
