PW[Sorin Gherman]PB[Anton Zatonskikh]DT[1994-08]EV[Hakone Go camp training game]PC[Hakone, Japan]C[Anton was one of the few non-asian inseis (he's Russian). His Go was very territorial.

This game was played at the Hakone Go camp, so it's more a training game than an official insei league one.
The result is't not recorded, but judging from the end position in this game record white must have won.
