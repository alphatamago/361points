(;B[nq]LB[op:a]C[Since black's interest is in the center in this game, this move should better be an ikken-kakari at "a". See the variation for more commentaries.]

(;W[nc]C[This is strange: normal is to play kakari from the other side (black would not be able to make many points on the upper side anyway because it is open on the left). See the variation.]

(;W[kc]LB[ld:a]C[This is too low: should be at "a".]
(;B[ho]LB[bl:a][bm:b]C[Black should play one point to the left, to strengthen his moyo. If white would play next the standard invasion at "a", black can reply severe at "b", attempting to kill the invader. ]
(;W[gj]LB[hi:a][ii:b]C[This is coming in too deep. White should play at "a" or "b": at either of these moves black has to attack from outside with boshi, he cannot win if he defends his left territory. So, why take risks and come in so deep?]

Missing such moves means losing the game.
See the variation for further discussion on this.]
(;W[ql]LB[kf:a]C[This idea behind this move is extremly bad: it makes black very strong in the lower-right area. 

White should play the perfect move at "a" which not only reverses the balance of power in the center(see preevious comments), but also helps the white stone on the right side. ]

(;B[pl]C[One possibility is for black to attack as he did in the game.]
;W[jd]C[White would have 2 weak groups if black gets to play here. In such situations, insuring one of the groups is a common strategy (as opposed to one's first instinct, to answer automatically the last attack on the right side. That stone cannot become safe in just one move, anyway).]

(;B[op]C[This high kakari is better here than a low one: black should concentrate on the center.]
;W[lp]
;B[go]C[In response to the white normal hasami, black returns on the left side and expands his moyo here. This shows how professionals don't care about josekis (which would call for black's answer in the lower right corner) but think about the game as a whole. I found this discovery very instructive.]
;W[pn]
;B[qq]C[When white continues his attacks in the lower right corner, black would like to settle issues here as locally and fast as possible: flying in the center is the normal option for black, but in this game that might hurt his central moyo. Again this shows how one should not follow fix thinking patterns every time, but judge each situation separately.]

;B[mq]C[This move is usually bad style, but here is consistent with black's strategy to settle things locally in this corner.]

;B[mp]C[Black has settled his position and white's lower side position is nothing to worry about due to black's 23 in the center.]))
