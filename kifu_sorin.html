    <h2>Commented Go Games From the Insei League </h2>

</a>
<p><a name="insei">I am posting here recorded Go games ("kifu" in Japanese) which I played in Japan as an insei. Some of
        them are teaching games I played against professionals, a few are informal, training games played with other
        inseis, but most are the official games I played in the insei league. (You can read about </a><a
        href="inseidetails.html">my experience as an insei</a>.)</p>
<p>Warning: the game comments (either by professionals or top inseis) are very short, pretty different from what you see
    in Go magazines. Professionals don't spend time to correct all of insei's wrong moves, they concentrate the analysis
    on just a few important points in the game (sometimes just 2 or so). They commentary ends when you make a very big
    mistake and the game is compromised. You may also be disappointed if you want to find complete games: most of them
    are recorded until the result is quite clear, some have only been partially recorded, only the fuseki or so, what's
    important here is the pro commentary).</p>
<p>On the other hand, I already started to turn some of my commented games information into detailed <a
        href="lessons.html">articles</a> - so you have one more way to learn from them.</p>
<p>I hope studying these game commentaries will help you get stronger. You can also just replay some of the games for
    fun, to get an idea about how inseis play.</p>
