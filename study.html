<h2>How to Improve Our Go Skills</h2>

<p>All Go players want to get stronger, to evolve in the understanding of this wonderful game.</p>

<p>Here are my ideas on how to improve at Go:</p>
<ul>   
   <li><strong><a href="playalot.html">Play a lot of games</a>.</strong></li>

   <li><strong>Apply newly learned concepts in our games.</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Theoretical knowledge should be put into practice.</li>
        <li>It is best to apply new knowledge in our games as soon as possible, while it is still fresh in our mind.</li>
        <li>Do not be afraid to just try things out.</li>
        </ul>
   </li>


   <li><strong><a href="studypro.html">Study professional games</a>.</strong>
   </li>

   <li><strong>Have our games commented by a stronger player.</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>In general, it is a very good idea to have a teacher - ideally, a professional Go player.</li>
        </ul>
   </li>

   <li><strong>Study Go problems ("tsumego").</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Solving a Go problem means to be 100% sure about the response we found: try not to look at the answers before that.</li>
        <li>Focus on solving many easy problems fast - better than working on very difficult ones. Most mistakes occur in simple situations during real games.</li>
        </ul>
   </li>
</ul>
