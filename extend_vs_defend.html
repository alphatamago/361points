<h2>A Time to Expand, and a Time to Defend</h2>

<p>Black to play in Dia 1.</p>
<p>This looks like a territory vs. influence game: White has 3 territories - about 10 points each - while Black has a lot of potential on the right and lower right, but no definite territory except in the upper-right corner.</p>
<p>Black seems to have a good game - and it is his turn to move, too. Make sure you analyze the position well before making the next move.</p>

<p>The lower right looks like the most interesting part of Black's moyo to expand - making a shimari here is standard. Dia 2 shows one of the many ways to strengthen a single <span class="jago">hoshi</span> stone.</p>
<p>If you focused on the Black moyo, though, you missed a very important aspect. Hint: think about balance, and positional judgement.</p>

<p>While Black has a great moyo on the right hand side, his position is quite thin in the upper-left. Considering that Black's moyo is so good, he shouldn't take any risk but spend a move to connect his weak stones, as in Dia 3. Once he did that, there is nothing else to worry about and he can concentrate on the moyo.</p>

<p>Dia 4 shows how White can split Black's positions in the upper left, causing trouble.</p>
<p>Black is thin in the upper left, and if White cuts here Black will have two groups to worry about.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Before starting on something juicy like building or expanding a moyo, make sure you don't have weak groups to defend first. Just imagine how exciting would be for your opponent to attack your groups if you don't defend!</li>
</ul>
