<p>Tei Meiko 9 dan was born in Taiwan in 1963 and moved to Japan in 1978 as he became insei. He became professional one year later and was promoted to 9 dan in 1993.</p>

<p>I met Tei Sensei in 1994, when I became <a href="inseidetails.html">insei in Japan</a>. He was one of the 3 official Nihon Ki-in insei instructors and he commented most of my <a href="kifu_sorin.html#insei">official insei games</a>. In fact, many of the <a href="lessons.html">lessons</a> I wrote are based on Tei Sensei's comments on my insei games.</p>

<p>He is a very nice person and also very special among professional players in Japan: Tei Sensei speaks English well and he is also a self-taught computer programmer! He is the author of Wakaba, a Go playing program than competed in several computer-Go tournaments in the past and also wrote software utilities like a game viewer applet.</p>

<p>I recently had an email exchange with Tei Sensei and asked him a few questions about studying Go, which I hope you will find interesting and useful.</p>

<div class="question">
<p>
I offer some <a href="study.html">study advices</a> on my website and the most controversial one is "Play many fast games" - people think I tell them to only play fast games, which was not my intention. What do you think about this advice?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Since playing games should be a pleasure,  I think it's a nice advice.</p>
<p>Maybe you can advice something like "Play many winning games", then everyone will agree with you, I suppose. :-) </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
What about recommending to review one's games?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Reviewing one's games is a good habit for someone who want to improve their Go skill. At the same time it needs one's (strong) will and efforts.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>What would you recommend amateurs at different levels to study: say, a 15 kyu vs. a 5 kyu vs. a 5 dan?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>I recommend the 'Read and Play' method for all levels:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read something new (Go book, article ...)</li>
<li>Play games to use the new knowledge</li>
<li>Beat your irritating Go-rival</li>
<li>Your skill and health will both improve :-)</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
At what stage in one's Go career is it best to learn joseki?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>At any stage, as necessary - for example, I am still learning joseki now, when some opponent makes a fishy move or so... I learn joseki both from books and from study groups (ken-kyu-kai).</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
Should joseki be memorized (even if not fully explored and understood), or just studied? This is a very popular question among beginners and I am also very interested in it because I found that when I know some joseki my brain tends to stop looking at other options.
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Memorizing joseki is a short cut to win games. Therefore one should memorize first and understand later.</p>
<p>I think for beginners it should be enough to memorize probably 5 basic joseki.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
So there is no such thing as "Don't learn joseki too early", or "Don't read go theory books too early"?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>The person who says "don't......" is just showing he doesn't know Go at all, I think. :-) </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
Is memorizing games a popular study method in Japan among strong amateurs or insei?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>I think so, yes. Since it's a convenient way to get knowledge by oneself. But the word 'memorizing' seems a little heavy, because it may need young brain. :-) So we can say 'viewing' pro games is popular among strong amateurs/insei.
</p></div>

<div class="question">
<p>
How would you compare memorizing pro games with studying them analytically (as in trying to see the meaning of moves)?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Trying to understand the moves is a good method for sure, but it may require some strong teacher to help the student figure out the meaning of the moves in a pro game.
</p><p>To compare the two studying methods above, memorizing is more popular I think.
</p><p>Basically studying pro games by oneself is not easy (even to me :-) ). So it would be better to study pro games with commentary and replaying them. Then you can memorize those games long and well.
</p></div>

<div class="question">
<p>
Do insei and professionals in Japan use game database software for studying purposes?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Young pro players do use computer to research and study games played by masters. As for database, I seldom hear that. Professionals normally find games they are interested in using their memory and books.</p>

<p>On the other hand, for pro players, they want to know eagerly how to win a game, but they may not need to know so much what was played in the past.</p>

<p>Ordinary pro Go players get their knowledge from books, magazines, study meetings, playing experience...(etc).</p>

<p>The only exception I know of is Hane sensei, from the Nagoya branch of Nihon Ki-in. He was famous for checking out Chinese-Style fuseki's win-rate statistically and using that knowledge in his games.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
What kind of Go books do professional players read for studying?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>All kind of books, if the content of the book is new and fresh to them. Pro-players who like reading would have interest to all kind of Go-books.
And, of course, pro-players who don't like reading would not read any books at all.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
Are there Go theory books that all insei/professionals normally read - for instance are there any "must read" books?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>I don't know about "must read" books.</p>
<p>For Go theory/strategy, I had read some books that I personally liked, for example <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?ZonePressPark" target="_blank">"The Zone Press Park"</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E6%9D%8E%E6%98%8C%E9%8D%8B-%E3%82%A4%E3%83%BC%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9B-%E7%A7%81%E3%81%AE%E4%B8%AD%E7%9B%A4%E6%88%A6%E7%95%A5-%E6%9D%8E-%E6%98%8C%E9%8D%8B/dp/4416700237" target="_blank">"Lee Changho's Strategy"</a></p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
Did the popularity of Hikaru-no-Go have any effect on the number of insei in Japan?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>The number of insei increased: 2 years ago there were more than 100 insei. Now the number of insei is down to about 80 (in Tokyo).</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
Do you know what is the current age limit for Western (non-Asian) insei? Many players dream of becoming insei in Japan after reading Hikaru-no-Go manga - then they find my website and ask me about it.
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Ordinary the age-limit for becoming insei is 14 and for pro is 26. But for Western young people (maybe under 30) with a pro's recommendation, it would be OK to study as a insei I suppose.</p>
</div>
