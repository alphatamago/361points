<h2>Sometimes It's Better Not to Know Joseki</h2>
<div class="author">by Sorin Gherman</div>
<div style="clear:both"></div>

<p>White to play next in dia 1.</p>
<p>Try to think of at least 2 alternative approaches, each with several follow-up moves.</p>

<div class="godia">
<img src="./not_know_joseki_files/f01.gif"><span class="godialbl">Dia 1</span>
</div>

<p>Dia 2 gives a bit of background about the position. I am White in this game from the <span class="jago">insei</span> league. My opponent has just played the triangle-marked contact move in the upper left, to prevent White's attack with A.</p>
<p>White would like very much to get to play first on the lower side, at B, to prevent Black from making a huge territory on the lower side. B also creates some possibility for White to isolate the 3 Black stones next to the lower right corner.</p>
<p>During the actual game I only considered the book follow-up moves for White in the upper-left: C and D. Visualising several of the normal continuations from each, nothing looked too promising for White. That is what I mean by "it is better not to know joseki": you get a lot of blind spots since your brain tends to ignore any non-standard move.</p>

<div class="godia">
<img src="./not_know_joseki_files/f02.gif"><span class="godialbl">Dia 2</span>
</div>

<p>White 1 in dia 3 is one of the 2 standard variations that I considered, and this is what I played in the game. White lost the initiative, and Black got to play first in the lower right, at 8.</p>
<p>White has already lost.</p>

<div class="godia">
<img src="./not_know_joseki_files/f03.gif"><span class="godialbl">Dia 3</span>
</div>

<p>In dia 4 we see the other standard variation.</p>
<p>After Black 2, White usually connects with A or B.</p>

<div class="godia">
<img src="./not_know_joseki_files/d01.gif"><span class="godialbl">Dia 4</span>
</div>

<p>There is actually a third possibility, which is to extend to White 1 in dia 5.</p>

<div class="godia">
<img src="./not_know_joseki_files/d02.gif"><span class="godialbl">Dia 5</span>
</div>

<p>Dia 6 shows the standard follow-up. This is usually labeled as "for special occasions", which means that White sacrifices the stone in the corner to build a wall on the outside. Of course, it doesn't make any sense for White to give away even more territory in the corner, and build a wall next to his existing one.</p>
<p>Instead of of playing the standard White 1 in dia 6, though, White has to be creative. Last chance to test your creativity now - before I spoil it and show the answer in the next diagram.</p>

<div class="godia">
<img src="./not_know_joseki_files/d03.gif"><span class="godialbl">Dia 6</span>
</div>

<p>One of the 3 official insei instructors, Tei Meiko 9 dan, showed me that White can play 1 in dia 7.</p>
<p>If you look at this move from a fighting perspective, it makes perfect sense: "extend from a cut", says a proverb.</p>
<p>It is very important to look at each position as a unique fight, not as a joseki. My mistake here was to regard the situation in the upper-left as a joseki, so I only considered the standard follow-ups that I knew about.</p>

<div class="godia">
<img src="./not_know_joseki_files/d04.gif"><span class="godialbl">Dia 7</span><p></p>
</div>

<p>If Black descends with 1 in dia 8, White makes eye shape in the corner with 4 and 8 - a combination to remember. Black has to defend with 7 against White A, but then White can attack severely with B.</p>
<p>This position doesn't look good at all for Black - suddenly White's wall came to life, and Black has weak groups.</p>

<div class="godia">
<img src="./not_know_joseki_files/d06.gif"><span class="godialbl">Dia 8</span>
</div>

<p>Black should actually extend with 1 in dia 9 - this is the locally correct move - but in this case it doesn't make much of a difference. Black is still floating in the middle of White's influence.</p>

<div class="godia">
<img src="./not_know_joseki_files/d05.gif"><span class="godialbl">Dia 9</span><p></p>
</div>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go is way too complex to be reduced at some recipe. Each position is unique and deserves full attention.</li>
<li>Knowing <span class="jago">joseki</span> doesn't mean we should stop thinking: if we do stop thinking, it's better not to know joseki in the first place.</li>
