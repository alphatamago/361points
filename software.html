<h2>Online Resources</h2>

<p>There are several online Go servers - so you can play Go on the internet anytime with players from around the world. I'm only listing here the ones I used and liked.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://online-go.com/" target="_blank">OGS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gokgs.com/" target="_blank">KGS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pandanet-igs.com/communities/pandanet" target="_blank">IGS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://world.cyberoro.com/" target="_blank">Cyberoro</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For a modern database search engine of pro game patterns, I recommend <a href="http://ps.waltheri.net/" target="_blank">Waltheri</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://gobase.org/" target="_blank">Gobase</a> is a website that offers both the database and the searching as an online service. Just follow the <a href="http://gobase.org/repository/" target="_blank">"Pattern search"</a> link, then "Enter your repository" and then "Edit board". It will return up to 100 professional games that match the position you entered.</p>

<p>The most popular, freely available computer AI system is <a href="https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo" target="_blank">KataGo</a>. It can give pro players 3 handicap stones for a balanced game.

</p><p>I use <a href="http://www.godrago.net/" target="_blank">Drago</a> - very lightweight download, my favourite software for recording and replaying games. I also use it to search game patterns in a game collection.

</p><p>The best Go encyclopedia I know of is <a href="http://gogodonline.co.uk/" target="_blank">GoGoD</a>. I bought this in 2001 or so (they must have added a lot to it meanwhile), but I was delighted with their articles on Go history, players, events...</p>

<p>While not an encyclopedia in the strict sense, <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/" target="_blank">Sensei's Library</a> is a wonderful resource. Use the search field to look up on anything Go related - you'll most of the times find something useful.

</p><p>Some of the Go servers do live broadcasts on the internet of top professional Go games.</p>
<p>In order to fully enjoy following these matches, I recommend to look up the players' names and career highlights in advance on <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/" target="_blank">Sensei's Library</a> to get familiar with them.</p>
<p>The best server I know of for live broadcasts is <a href="http://world.cyberoro.com/" target="_blank">Cyberoro</a>. One can see live pro games being played almost daily. </p>

<p>For online communities, I recommend <a href="http://lifein19x19.com/" target="_blank">LifeIn19x19</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/" target="_blank">Reddit Baduk</a>.</p>
