<h2>To Improve at Go, Play a Lot of Games</h2>
<div class="author">by Sorin Gherman</div>
<div style="clear:both"></div>

<p>
This is part of my <a href="http://361points.com/study/">"how to improve"</a> advices.
</p>
<p>
This used to be "Play a lot of fast games" - but I found that so many readers were confused, that I decided to change the title. I discussed this briefly recently with Tei Meiko 9p, one of the official instructors during the period when I was insei in Japan - he suggested to change the title to something like "Play many winning games" to turn it into an advice everybody will enjoy following :-) 

</p><p>There are several aspects to this advice:
</p><ul>
<li>One has to play a lot in order to gain experience.</li>
<li>One has to push himself to play faster in order to be successful in competitive Go.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Among the first things that my sensei, Kobayashi Chizu 5p, told me when I became <a href="http://361points.com/inseidetails/">insei in Japan</a> was: "Play a lot of fast games with the other insei - never mind the results, just play!". (As insei, "fast games" meant 10 seconds per move, no extra thinking time.)
</p>

<p>
Another related advice, that may not be applicable in your case, was to lure other insei into playing a lot of fast games with me by offering them candy or so - basically most of the Asian insei were kids :-) Instead of looking for strong Go kids and offering them candy - which may get you in trouble in some places - it is much safer and easier nowadays to just get a free online account on a Go server and you can find anytime someone to play with.
</p>

<p>
I don't think anybody questions the "play a lot" advice - after all it is common sense that one gets stronger with experience. But many persons asked me "Why fast games? What is wrong with normal, or even slow games?".</p>

<p>There is of course nothing wrong with playing slow games, but <strong>you should also play many fast games</strong>: try to force yourself, gradually, even a little bit at a time, to <strong>play with slightly lower time limits than what you are comfortable with</strong>. This way you will read faster, concentrate on the important areas, and think more efficiently. Just like athletes are pushing their physical limits.
</p>

<p>
If you only play within your comfort zone when it comes to time limits, you play mostly for enjoyment, not for improvement.
